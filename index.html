    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      Gulf Trust Cycle (GTC) is a member-driven financial cooperative initiative
      being built by members working abroad, guided by shared values of trust,
      discipline, and collective economic empowerment. GTC is structured in the
      spirit of Kenyan SACCOs, enabling members to save consistently, access
      affordable credit, and grow together through responsible investment.
    </p>

    <p>
      The initiative is actively being developed with a long-term vision of
      financial stability, transparency, and sustainable wealth creation for
      its members.

  <!-- HOW IT WORKS -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>How GTC Works</h2>
    <p>
      GTC operates on principles similar to registered SACCOs in Kenya. Members
      make regular deposits which form the core savings pool of the cooperative.
      These deposits enable members to access affordable credit while also
      supporting collective investments.
    </p>

    <p>
      Credit facilities are offered to members at relatively low interest rates,
      with flexible repayment periods, subject to agreed terms and member
      eligibility. Interest earned contributes to the cooperative’s growth and
      eventual member dividends.
    </p>

    <p>
      Profits generated through interest and approved investments are shared
      among members as dividends in accordance with their contributions and
      participation.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- TRANSPARENCY & GOVERNANCE -->
  <section class="section light">
    <h2>Transparency & Governance</h2>
    <p>
      For accountability and transparency, Gulf Trust Cycle operates through a
      joint account held with Equity Bank, managed by multiple signatories acting
      on behalf of the members. Members are entitled to view transaction records
      and financial statements.
    </p>

    <p>
      GTC is guided by designated elective roles established to represent the
      collective interests of members. These positions exist to uphold fairness,
      integrity, and member-centered decision-making rather than individual
      authority.
    </p>

    <p>
      Physical audits and financial reports will be regularly presented to
      members, allowing full verification of records and operations.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- LEGAL FRAMEWORK -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Legal Framework</h2>
    <p>
      GTC operates in alignment with Kenyan cooperative principles and is guided
      by the Cooperative Societies Act (Cap 490, Laws of Kenya). In matters of
      credit default or dispute, applicable legal provisions allow the
      cooperative to safeguard member funds in a lawful and structured manner.
    </p>

    <p>
      Members agree to abide by the constitution, bylaws, and legal obligations
      governing the cooperative.
