  <!-- HOW IT WORKS -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>How GTC Works</h2>
    <p>
      Gulf Trust Cycle operates under cooperative principles similar to registered SACCOs in Kenya.
      Members contribute regular savings which form the core capital of the cooperative.
      These savings enable members to access affordable credit while maintaining collective ownership of the fund.
    </p>

    <p>
      Credit facilities are issued at fair and low interest rates, with flexible repayment periods.
      All interest earned contributes to the cooperative’s growth and is eventually returned to members
      through dividends, reinvestment, or asset acquisition.
    </p>

    <p>
      GTC is structured to invest in sustainable assets over time, strengthening the cooperative’s balance sheet
      and ensuring long-term financial stability for members.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- TRANSPARENCY -->
  <section class="section light">
    <h2>Transparency & Accountability</h2>
    <p>
      For transparency and accountability, Gulf Trust Cycle operates through a joint bank account held with Equity Bank.
      The account has multiple signatories, ensuring that no single individual controls the funds.
      Members are able to view and track transactions to promote openness and trust.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, physical audits and financial reports are regularly presented to members.
      Members have the right to physically audit records, statements, and financial activities of the cooperative.
    </p>

    <p>
      Leadership and operational roles within GTC are designated through member-based, elective processes.
      These roles exist solely to represent the interests of members and are guided by fairness, integrity,
      and collective decision-making.
    </p>
