    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Gulf Trust Cycle (GTC) is a savings and credit cooperative currently being built by members
      united by a shared vision of economic empowerment, responsibility, and collective growth.
      The idea of GTC grows from everyday conversations, shared challenges, and a strong desire
      to create a reliable financial institution owned by its members.

      transparent management. It is not merely a financial entity, but a long-term commitment
      to building stability, trust, and opportunity for current and future members.

  <!-- ABOUT GTC -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>What Gulf Trust Cycle Is About</h2>
    <p>
      Gulf Trust Cycle operates on the same cooperative principles that guide successful
      Savings and Credit Cooperative Organizations (SACCOs) in Kenya. It is a member-owned
      institution focused on savings mobilization, affordable credit provision, and long-term
      wealth creation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Members save regularly, creating a pool of funds that is used to support lending,
      investments, and other cooperative activities. Through unity and discipline, GTC
      enables members to achieve financial goals that would be difficult individually.
    </p>

  <!-- HOW IT WORKS -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>How Gulf Trust Cycle Works</h2>
    <p>
      As a member, you contribute savings to your personal account within the cooperative.
      These savings form the foundation of your borrowing capacity and ownership in GTC.
    </p>
    <p>
      Members qualify for loans of up to three times their savings, subject to cooperative
      policies and guarantees. Any loan amount exceeding a member’s savings requires
      guarantors, with each guarantor committing no more than 80% of their own savings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loans are offered at low interest rates and repaid over agreed periods, ensuring
      affordability and sustainability. This system protects members’ savings while
      enabling access to credit when needed.
    </p>

  <!-- DIVIDENDS & INVESTMENTS -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Dividends, Investments & Growth</h2>
    <p>
      Gulf Trust Cycle invests surplus funds into income-generating assets and services.
      Profits earned are shared annually among members as dividends, in proportion to
      their savings and participation.
    </p>
    <p>
      This approach ensures that members benefit not only from access to credit, but also
      from the long-term growth and value of the cooperative.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- LEGAL FRAMEWORK -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Legal Framework</h2>
    <p>
      Gulf Trust Cycle operates in accordance with the cooperative laws of Kenya,
      specifically under the <strong>Co-operative Societies Act, Cap 490 of the Laws of Kenya</strong>.
      This legal framework governs the formation, management, lending, recovery, and
      protection of members’ funds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any member who defaults on obligations is subject to lawful recovery procedures
      as provided under Kenyan cooperative law.
